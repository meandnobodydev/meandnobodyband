                    <p>I missed you, you must have got in the cab.
                        <br></br> 
                    And I want you, but not that bad.
                    <br></br> 
                    Anarchy in my head now, is it bad love feels like a dead flower? 
                    <br></br> 
                    I saw you at the back of the bar and I knew you, the one that's stealing my heart. 
                    <br></br> 
                    Blame it on good luck baby, sultry ways like 1980 now. 
                    <br></br>

                    <p>
                    And the taste of cigarettes on my tongue, is coming off her lips.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Oh, it's taking a toll on my mind and I can't feel it. 
                    <br></br> 
                    Oh, you're getting cold and you say "Stop, I'm leaving." 
                    <br></br> 
                    And I'll say that I'm abused from wanting what I didn't use. 
                    <br></br> 
                    Oh it's taking a toll on my mind and I can't feel it now.

                    <br></br> 
                    Inside a current state now, love is like a chorus of comedowns.  
                    <br></br> 
                    You found me in the back of my car and I knew you could take it this far. 
                    <br></br> 
                    Breathe me in, entrap me, sultry ways like 1980 now.

                    <p>
                    The Cab is the first song we wrote together as a band and holds a special place in our hearts. 
                    <p>
                     The lyrical meaning behind this song is a story of two people with a history seeing each other in a pub. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     This leads to both of them catching those temporary in the moment feelings about one another which could either lead to disappointment or happiness. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     Either you see them running off in The Cab alone or you end up in The Cab with them. 
                     </p>
                     Hence why the track title is called The Cab because it’s the deciding factor of what path you choose in those moments.

                    <p>This track is based off of the feelings you get when dating in a long distance relationship that you don’t really want to be in anymore. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    But, you’re too afraid to tell that person exactly how you feel so you just write these feeling off and bury them until the whole relationship blows up. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    When you finally get the courage to say how you really feel the lyrics, “I’m going down to SoHo” hit home because of all that anticipation and build up while traveling to that place for the last time truly starts to sink in.

                            Life moves fast so don't stop now.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And you know this.
                            <br></br>
                            And it's worth it.
                            <br></br>
                            So take my hand and don't look back.
                            <br></br>
                            Just refocus and ignore this.
                            <br></br>
                            Let's keep this up to keep running through the red.
                            <br></br>
                            Keep running through the red.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Wake up, take a breathe.
                            <br></br>
                            Fresh air never felt like sex.

                            Twenty-five and feeling young,
                            <br></br>
                            let's stay out all night long.

                            <br></br>
                            Cause it's you and I,
                            <br></br>
                            it's you and I.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Never grow up so take a breathe.
                            <br></br>
                            Show yourself, you're nothing less than perfect.
                            <br></br>
                            Can you notice?

                        “keep running through the red” was the first thing I wrote down one day and had it sitting in my phone for months with no musical context whatsoever. 
                        </p>
                        What it boils down is to just keep pushing through all the bullshit trying to stop you from reaching your goals. 
                        <p>
                        Sometimes it’s easier to have negative thoughts and make excuses but if you keeping pushing past that and stay positive, things will work out in your favor.
